# React Redux (Toolkit) - CRUD

This is a simple React Redux project including (Redux -> Toolkit) which is a nice State Mng. Tool;

You can start simple by using this project to get going/moving forward just to kinda learn how fun is to work with Redux comparing to props drilling or context wrapping thing is a pain to work with within big projects or seperated stuff.

Anyway if you like this give it a star;
